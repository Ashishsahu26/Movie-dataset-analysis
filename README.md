Data Analysis on Movie Dataset using Python 

Explored libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a movie dataset to uncover trends and patterns across features like Genre, Popularity, Vote Count, and Release Year. Utilized Pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing, cleaning, missing value handling, and deriving new insights from structured data. Created data visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn, including bar plots, line charts, histograms, and count plots to represent relationships and distributions.

# Conclussion through the analysis:

Most popular genres over the years.
Distribution of vote averages and vote counts.
Trends in movie releases by year.
Correlation between popularity and ratings.

Generated actionable insights for viewer preferences and genre-based performance using visual storytelling.

Demonstrated skills in data wrangling, data-driven storytelling, and effective use of Python libraries for analysis.
